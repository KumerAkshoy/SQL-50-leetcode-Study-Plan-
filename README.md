🧠 SQL-50 LeetCode Study Plan

Welcome to my SQL-50 LeetCode Study Plan!
This repository documents my daily journey of solving the LeetCode SQL-50 problems — a collection of 50 curated SQL challenges designed to strengthen query-building, database logic, and analytical skills.

📘 About the Project

The goal of this study plan is to consistently practice and master SQL by solving one problem per day.
Each day’s solution will be shared as a PDF file, containing:

  🔗 Problem Link – Direct link to the original LeetCode problem

  📝 Problem Description – A short overview of what the problem asks for

  💡 Approach – Explanation of the thought process and key concepts used

  🧩 Solution – Final SQL query with explanations or comments

🧭 Objectives

  1.Strengthen SQL fundamentals (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, JOIN, etc.)

  2.Learn efficient query writing techniques

  3.Understand complex problem-solving approaches using SQL

  4.Build a solid foundation for Data Analysis and Backend Testing

🛠️ Tools & Environment

  :: Platform: LeetCode SQL Problems

  :: Database Engine: MySQL (compatible syntax)

  :: Editor: LeetCode SQL Editor / Local SQL Client

  :: Format: PDF (for portability and readability)

🚀 How to Use

  Browse the /solutions directory.

  Open any day’s PDF file.
